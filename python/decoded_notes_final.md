Symbol of Medicine : Serpents

In Greek mythology, the **Rod of ****Asclepius** (⚕; sometimes also spelled **Asklepios** or **Aesculapius**), also known as the **asklepian**,[1] is a serpent-entwined rod wielded by the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicine. The symbol has continued to be used in modern times, where it is associated with medicine and health are, yet frequently confused with the staff of the god Hermes, the caduceus.

Caduceus: - Staff of Hermes with 2 snakes: "The long-standing and abundantly attested historical **associations of the caduceus with commerce, theft, deception, and death** are considered by any to be inappropriate in a symbol used by those engaged in the healing arts." [Engle, Bernice (Dec 1929). "The Use of Mercury's Caduceus as a Medical Emblem"". *The Classical Journal* **25** (1): 205.]

cup does stand for fatal judgment

I urge that the cup does stand for fatal judgment in Rev 14:9–11 for two reasons. First, outside Revelation, ultimate extinction is everywhere else in Scripture the clearly-described destiny of the wicked. Second, the three other symbols used in Rev 14:9–11, when used in Scripture outside Revelation, either mean (fire and brimstone; smoke ascending) or are consistent with (no rest day or night) a judgment that ends in death.

---

### 143: None

46. Rev 14:10–14 and Rev 20:10 are the two biblical texts that come closest to affirming unending conscious torment, and they are the only two texts that do. Traditionalists frequently resort to those two passages whenever they encounter any of the scores of other Scriptures that seem directly to contradict their view. Although simplistic, it is almost fair to say that his whole debate rests finally on one question: should we interpret dozens of straightforward texts throughout the Bible to match the literal sense of two symbolic texts in the Apocalypse, or ought we to interpret the two apocalyptic texts symbolically to conform to the any others? It is highly unlikely that, on any other subject, any of our traditionalist brothers or sisters finally base an entire doctrine on two texts from Revelation.

is torment the only type of punishment? No, we cannot assume the content or nature of the punishment: execution, or *eternal destruction* as in 2 Thes 1:9 - here the punishment is defined

### 398: None

**Fire not quenched**

Irresistable fire that cannot be put out before it has done its job of destruction: see Eze 20:47-48

---

### 399: None

*worm not die **… ****fire not quenched***

In Isa 66 eternal torment is not in view, but people being consumed by maggots and fire. An abhorrent scene. Dead bodies that will remain for a while.

Thus those who rebell will be thrown into Gehenna. Must be guided by the view of Isa 66.

endless supply of food and fuel? - absurdity of his image Not a fire that will never run out of fuel, but a fire that will never be quenched. Burns until it has done its job. Ezekiel 20:47 blazing fire that will not be stopped.

*Parable of the **… **Man and Lazarus*

1) its a parable, not a map of the afterlife - not necessarily a true story. possibly a story that was popular among the people. It was not about the afterlife. Compare to a story from the Palestinian Talmud. wealth was not an evidence of Gods favor. 'Lazurus' means God helps.

2) no final judgment depicted, and no eternal punishment mentioned. depicts the intermediate state. Hades is Sheol, the grave not Gehenna (hell).

Eternal **Destruction**

1) the act annihilation is punctual, but cannot be eternal, but the resulting destruction can be eternal

results last forever: cp. eternal sin Mk 3:29, eternal salvation Heb 5:9, 6:2

2) removed "from from the presence of the Lord" by being destroyed (NIV has it wrong) exclusion by means of destruction

Gk apoleia in verse 6 denotes destruction by the flood, so it must mean the same in verse 7

---

### 414: None

*example … punishment** of ****eternal fire***

example - see 2 Pet 2:6 a realistic sample of what eternal fire is like. Gen 19:24-28 all was devastatedt, nothing left except smoke. No picture of torment forever.

---

### 415: None

***tormented****** with fire**** … in the PRESENCE of the Lamb*

tomented with fire and brimstone: it does not say for how long. the expected end result is destruction, as it was in Isa 34, and not eternal torment.

how can death be eternal SEPARATION from God when the torment is in HIS PRESENCE?

---

### 416: None

*the smoke of … ****torment**** ascends forever*

it depicts an angel warning about a punishment on the followers of the beast, which will be seen later in verses 14 to 20: winepress, destruction with blood flowing

smoke forever - unsaved burn forever? see Isa 34:8-10 the smoke rises up as a reminder of the destruction forever. A permanent memorial. the destruction involved torment: compare with Revelation 18:10 where the torment is part of the destruction

- but what about "they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name" ?

---

### 417: None

*Her ****smoke rises ******… ******forever ****and ever*

obviously the smoke will not literally be seen rising up for all eternity, as further up we see a new heaven and a new earth

Babylon destroyed - cp Rev 14:11, Isa 34:8-10

---

### 418: None

*cast alive into ****lake of fire****… burning with brimstone*

the beast is not a person, but a kingdom or an empire, a corporate entity

the false prophet is probably a world religious system

the devil could be the dragon seen before possibly representing the whole rebellious angelic kingdom of darkness: "into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels" Mt 25:41

---

### 419: None

***The devil tormented ******… ******forever and ever !?***

***his seems to contradict the Bible teaching of:***

1) Immortality is a gift - not bestowed upon the wicked

2) Vision of eternity - future absence of evil

3) Destruction of the lost - Mt 10:28, Mt 7:13, Mt 13:51, Rom 3:23, 2Th 1:9, 2 Pet 2:6

Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me: 18 When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your and. 19 Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your and. 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.”

Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?

28 “So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 29 and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

31 “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

On the next day, as had now become necessary, Judas and his men went to take up the bodies of the fallen and to bring them back to lie with their kindred in the sepulchres of their ancestors. 40 Then under the tunic of each one of the dead they found sacred tokens of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. And it became clear to all that his was the reason these men had fallen. 41 So they all blessed the ways of the Lord, the righteous judge, who reveals the things that are hidden; 42 and they turned to supplication, praying that the sin that had been committed might be wholly blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened as the result of the sin of those who had fallen. 43 He also took up a collection, man by man, to the amount of two thousand drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering. In doing his he acted very well and honorably, taking account of the resurrection. 44 For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. 45 But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who all asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, so that they might be delivered from their sin.

During trials we need wisdom

As described in James 1:1-2 we experience any trials which produce endurance, if we overcome them by faith.

In order to overcome these trials and temptations, we need God's wisdom during the difficult situations which we face and we should fully expect by faith to receive an answer from God, which will help us overcome.

The condition for receiving God's wisdom is, that we ask in faith without being doubleminded.
