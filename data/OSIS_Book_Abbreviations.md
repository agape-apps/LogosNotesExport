# Bible Book Abbreviations for OSIS and Sword

## Introduction

What follows is a list of abbreviations for books of the Bible, for use with OSIS and Sword as standard book IDs. The basis for most of these works is the *SBL Handbook of Style*¹.

The intent of this list is to provide abbreviations for all texts considered by any extant Jewish or Christian sect to be a part of the Bible and for all texts included within significant historical works considered Bibles. Texts that are essentially sectarian in nature are not included in this list, though a work with recognized antiquity separate from the community that currently uses it may be included in this list even if only one sect currently recognizes it as biblical. Historical canon lists are also not considered authoritative for the purposes of this list.

For the purposes of this list, historical works considered Bibles includes works of which there are numerous copies, such as the Vulgate or LXX, as well as important manuscripts, such as Codex Sinaiticus. While the *SBL Handbook of Style* provides most of the data included here, there are some ambiguities and omissions in its presentation. Ambiguities are clarified here primarily on the assumption that first mention is primary and preferential. Omissions are filled in by following practices illustrated in abbreviation of other books included by the *SBL Handbook of Style* and by reference to abbreviations in use by other parties.

To the extent possible, Paratext abbreviations have been given for each book, based in large part on BFBS' data². However, many of the Paratext abbreviations given here are rare, deprecated, considered obsolete, or not formally standardized.

The sections marked with *, consisting of the Old & New Testaments, Apocrypha, and additional texts found in Rahlfs' LXX and the Vulgate, are the most common texts and those most likely to be encountered in documents, especially documents produced within Western church traditions. Books marked with a † are absent from the *SBL Handbook of Style*, so their abbreviations are synthesized.

Exhaustive though this document attempts to be, there are inevitably omissions which may be addressed in future versions. Lists of IDs for other, extra-biblical, books (pseudepigrapha, NT apocrypha, etc.) may be found elsewhere and may serve as an additional resource for Bibles with books not included here.
