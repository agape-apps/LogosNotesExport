2025-07-15 (Refactoring) refactor: Move main export logic from CLI to unified core LogosNotesExporter class for code reuse
- Created new LogosNotesExporter class in packages/core/src/exporter.ts with configurable logging and progress callbacks
- Refactored CLI to use the unified core exporter instead of duplicated logic
- Updated Electron export-handler.ts to use the same core exporter with IPC callbacks
- Added database adapter (database-adapter.ts) to handle bun:sqlite compatibility in Electron webpack environment
- Configured webpack alias to map bun:sqlite to better-sqlite3 adapter for Electron builds
- Both CLI and Electron now use identical export logic from core, ensuring consistency and reducing maintenance overhead

- Removed unused imports: ExportProgress, detectDatabaseLocations, getDatabaseSearchInstructions, RendererToMain
- Cleaned up unused variables: mode in main.ts, event parameter in close handler, detectLogosDatabase function
- Added ESLint ignore patterns for webpack and forge config files to prevent TypeScript parsing conflicts
- Verified successful Electron app startup with all type safety improvements and zero linting errors
