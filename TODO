# TODO

- CI/DI
- testing
- Electron app

- book highlights need reference to book, only Logos abbreviation is available
- get resourceid text: only Logos abbreviation is available, possibly create web link
- highlight range from books is impossible
- highlight range for verses could just output the whole verse highlighted 

GENERAL
- note that this is beta software
- note that not all command option combinations have been tested

OPTIONS
- this may not be needed: --no-notebook-info    Exclude notebook information (default: include)


## Main Use Cases

### Backup (working)
- backup of all notes
- backup of all highlights (by Bible verse OK, but from books)
- prevent vendor lock-in of data
- requires max amount of meta-data

### Use in other Apps like Obsidian (working)
- folder structure by Notebook
- Named in easy to sort manner
- focus on meta data that is useful in Obsidian

### Similar to Export/Print (not implemented yet)
- use in Word, Libreoffice, elsewhere 
- needs the scripture references, possibly book reference
- list of Notes from one Notebook
- only minimal metadata
