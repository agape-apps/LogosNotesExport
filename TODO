# TODO

- testing with jest unit tests
- more testing test on Windows
- test on Apple Silicon
- check error handling, especially for databases

BUGS
- fix src/xaml-converter.ts 
    - missing double space for new line (for some Markdown readers)
    - missing blank lines
    - Links not converting

FEATURES
- try to implement this as an Electron app

CANNOT FIX
- to get the text which corresponds to the highlight range from books is impossible, as we do not have access to the content of book resources
- highlight range for verses can only output the whole verse highlighted 
- this could only be implemented by Logos with their own exporter from within the app

GENERAL
- note that not all command option combinations have been tested

OPTIONS
- this option may not be needed: --no-notebook-info Exclude notebook information (default: include)

## Main Use Cases

### Backup (working)
- backup of all notes
- backup of all highlights (by Bible verse OK, but from books)
- prevent vendor lock-in of data
- requires max amount of meta-data

### Use in other Apps like Obsidian (working)
- folder structure by Notebook
- Named in easy to sort manner
- focus on meta data that is useful in Obsidian

### Similar to Export/Print (not implemented yet)
- use in Word, Libreoffice, elsewhere 
- needs the scripture references, possibly book reference
- list of Notes from one Notebook
- only minimal metadata
