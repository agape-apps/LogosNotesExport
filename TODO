# TODO

### BUGS
- when exporting notes after the first start the screen refreshes and the log disappears
  - after centralizing the settings

- testing with jest unit tests
- more testing on Windows
- test on Apple Silicon
- improve error handling, for databases, for conversion issues

### Binary Builds

- [ ] Electron: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/forge-overview

---

from Bear:

### XAML Conversion - add/check
- If regular Markdown is copied into Notes using the default font (10 - 12 size), then the formatting will be maintained as plain text Markdown (should not be modified by the converter)
- only convert formatting instructions from XAML formatting

- [ ] fix complex unordered list
- [ ] fix complex ordered list (fix)
- [x] fix indents, they get ignored
- [ ] use one indent without list as block quote (Optional)

- tabs turn into code (in many Markdown readers), convert to indents instead (OPTION IN SETTINGS)
- four spaces can turn into code (nut not always?)

- [ ] improve subscript/superscript options (OPTION IN SETTINGS)
  * Subscript~123~ Superscript^123^ for Typora (Obsidian with plugin)
- [ ] improve small caps CAPITAL<small> only small letters in small caps (optional)

- [ ] add more flexible conversion options (depending on Markdown target) (OPTIONS IN SETTINGS)
- [ ] explore Images
- [ ] font sizes 24 and up is H1
- [ ] font size 9 and below is <small>
- [ ] Note to user: not everything converts nicely
- Add support for other monospace Font Names

### Database
- [ ] Note to user: Logos can be open safely, as sqlite is used read only - verify that this will not cause a lock on usage in Logos!

### For LibreOffice
- Paste Markdown from Typora and MarkText (same result)
- Export to Word .docx from Typora
### For Obsidian 
- [x] view formatted notes one by one
- [ ] view all notes from one notebook in one document, similar to the notes exporter
  - [ ] Verse references
  - [ ] Book references 
  - [ ] Note text
  - [ ] â€”- divider
  - [ ] optionally exclude highlights
  - [ ] Use README.md index files for that
- [ ] Obsidian plugins could show verses on hover. Many recognize Bible references and can also link to a Bible for example
- [ ] Note names are unique and could be linked to with Wikilinks from other notes in Obsidian 
### Issues to check 
- [ ] How about multiple Anchors?
- [ ] How to manage highlight notes without text?
  - [ ] add scripture from WEB (World English Bible)
  - [ ] Just add the reference range in the Markdown
- [ ] Why are there notes of type highlight which have text in them?

### Bible Notes filenames for file system sorting 
macOS and Windows 10/11

### Current Format
OT, AP or NT
(logosBibleBook)
(underscore) _
(OSIS book abbr.)
(minus) -
(chapter 2 digits)
(period) .
(Verse 2 digits)

**Examples:**
- OT02_Exod-06.10.md
- AP40_Tob-14.07.md
- NT86_Jude-01.02.md
- NT87_Rev-01.01.md

### More readable Format
OT02 Exodus 06.10 - 06.14.md
NT26 Jude 01.02.md
NT27 Revelation 01.01.md

- OT, NT and AP for easy discovery in file system
- Logos Book Numbers with double digits for sorting 
  - Keeps it in mostly Biblical Order
  - Use adjusted Book Numbers:
  - OT01-39
  - NT01-27 (subtract 60)
  - AP01-20 (subtract 40)
- Possibly include marked range
- we need double digits for chapters and verses for sorting
- adding a chapter number for 1-chapter Bible books (like Jude)
- with space is more readable and still sorts well
- `:` cannot be used in filenames?

### Note Export Folders
- Notes - Notebook - NT27 Revelation 01.01.md

### Front Matter
- Scripture: 
- Version:
- Date Created
- Date Modified 
- Highlight
- Notebook:
- Info: ID-Ver-

### Main Content:
- Optional Metadata
- Scripture
- Title
- Note

### Options
- [x] Overwrite notes (default, inform users)
- [x] Export all
- [ ] Export just one Notebook (usefull for big collections)
- [ ] Export by Tags (not tested tags yet)
- [ ] Export a Notebook into one Markdown file (see above)
- [ ] Include the scripture reference in notes text (see above)
- [ ] Heading sizes based on available sizes in Logos (add in-between sizes as well)
- [ ] Normal Font: 12, 11, 10 (and below)
- [ ] Small font: 9 (and below) <small>
- [ ] Simplify Options
  * only Obsidian useful options for the default setting
  * export highlights in advanced
  * all Metadata for backup purposes
  * all notes on one page (Notebook export) with only essential metadata for actual use (in Word or for printing)
  * individual options in hiddden panel

### German version?

---

GUI

- move Progress UI to right side above log and display in both modes
- Move to better-sqlite3 Throughout Core Package docs/migrate-to-better-sqlite.md
- Implement improvements, refactoring from Electron App Evaluation docs/EVALUATION.md

BUGS

- fix src/xaml-converter.ts
  - still too many blank lines in some cases, but mostly looking good
- invalid offsets (-1) have been fixed but the book link is not that useful - check other options:
  - anchorLink: "https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3A1.0.20"
  - in Logos-Exported-Notes/Conditional Immortality/LLS-1.0.20-0736.md
  - add a tag or note?
- is it ok for list items to have a double space at the line ending?

CODE DUPLICATION

- Multiple "Get human-readable note type name" includes annotation as 2 or unknown (inconsistently)
- only note (text) and highlights are actual note types, annotation should be the same as unknown

FEATURES

- investigate how to implement this as a simple Electron app
- possibly add empty note Tag to notes like Heavenly Citizens - Phil. Ch. 3/NT71_Phil-03.20.md (remove notice text)

CANNOT FIX

- to get the highlighted text which corresponds to the highlight range from books is impossible, as we do not have access to the content of book resources
- highlight range for verses can only output the whole verse highlighted (not word by word range)
- this could only be implemented by Logos with their own exporter from within the app

GENERAL

- note that not all command option combinations have been tested

OPTIONS

- this option may not be needed: --no-notebook-info Exclude notebook information (default: include)

### KEEP bun:sqlite !
**DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE STEPS BELOW, because then the Bun binary builds will not work any more**
- Update core package to use better-sqlite3 instead of bun:sqlite for universal Node.js/Bun compatibility.
- Removed 55-line database adapter layer from Electron package as it's no longer needed.
- Eliminated duplicate SQLite dependencies between packages for simplified dependency management.
- Verified CLI functionality works correctly with Bun runtime using better-sqlite3 Node.js module.
- Verified Electron functionality works correctly using better-sqlite3 Node.js module.
- Tested this version, but does not work for this project as binary builds become impractical.

## Main Use Cases

### Backup (working)

- backup of all notes
- backup of all highlights (by Bible verse OK, but not from books)
- prevent vendor lock-in of data
- show max amount of meta-data

### Use in other Apps like Obsidian (working)

- folder structure by Notebook
- Named in easy to sort manner
- focus on meta data that is useful in Obsidian

### Similar to Export/Print (not implemented yet)

- use in Word, Libreoffice, elsewhere
- needs the scripture references, possibly book reference
- list of Notes from one Notebook
- only minimal metadata
- could be added to the index file
