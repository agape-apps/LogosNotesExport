# TODO

- test with live Databases 

- testing with jest
- test on Windows
- test on Apple Silicon
- Electron app

LIMITED FIX
- get resourceid text: only Logos abbreviation is available, possibly create web link
- book highlights need reference to book name, only Logos abbreviation is available
  - possibly add a web link using Logos abbreviation

CANNOT FIX
- highlight range from books is impossible
- highlight range for verses can only output the whole verse highlighted 

GENERAL
- note that this is beta software
- note that not all command option combinations have been tested

OPTIONS
- this may not be needed: --no-notebook-info    Exclude notebook information (default: include)

### ResourceId - where to find the associated title

- resourcemanager.db has the HiddenResources table which provides a title for each ResourceId
- hide a bunch of resources, copy the title, then unhide


## Main Use Cases

### Backup (working)
- backup of all notes
- backup of all highlights (by Bible verse OK, but from books)
- prevent vendor lock-in of data
- requires max amount of meta-data

### Use in other Apps like Obsidian (working)
- folder structure by Notebook
- Named in easy to sort manner
- focus on meta data that is useful in Obsidian

### Similar to Export/Print (not implemented yet)
- use in Word, Libreoffice, elsewhere 
- needs the scripture references, possibly book reference
- list of Notes from one Notebook
- only minimal metadata
