# TODO

- testing with jest unit tests
- more testing on Windows
- test on Apple Silicon
- improve error handling, for databases, for conversion issues

BUGS
- fix src/xaml-converter.ts 
    - still too many blank lines in some cases, but mostly looking good
- invalid offsets (-1) have been fixed but the book link is not that useful - check other options: 
  - anchorLink: "https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3A1.0.20"
  - in Logos-Exported-Notes/Conditional Immortality/LLS-1.0.20-0736.md
  - add a tag or note?
- is it ok for list items to have a double space at the line ending?

CODE DUPLICATION
- Multiple "Get human-readable note type name" includes annotation as 2 or unknown (inconsistently)
- only note (text) and highlights are actual note types, annotation should be the same as unknown

FEATURES
- investigate how to implement this as a simple Electron app
- possibly add empty note Tag to notes like Heavenly Citizens - Phil. Ch. 3/NT71_Phil-03.20.md (remove notice text)

CANNOT FIX
- to get the highlighted text which corresponds to the highlight range from books is impossible, as we do not have access to the content of book resources
- highlight range for verses can only output the whole verse highlighted (not word by word range)
- this could only be implemented by Logos with their own exporter from within the app

GENERAL
- note that not all command option combinations have been tested

OPTIONS
- this option may not be needed: --no-notebook-info Exclude notebook information (default: include)

## Main Use Cases

### Backup (working)
- backup of all notes
- backup of all highlights (by Bible verse OK, but not from books)
- prevent vendor lock-in of data
- show max amount of meta-data

### Use in other Apps like Obsidian (working)
- folder structure by Notebook
- Named in easy to sort manner
- focus on meta data that is useful in Obsidian

### Similar to Export/Print (not implemented yet)
- use in Word, Libreoffice, elsewhere 
- needs the scripture references, possibly book reference
- list of Notes from one Notebook
- only minimal metadata
- could be added to the index file
