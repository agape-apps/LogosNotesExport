# Logos Notes Exporter and Converter

A simple node based CLI exporter that converts Logos Notes to Markdown files

The command takes one or more database files as input
- with options for database file locations
- with various options for the user to customize the output

It outputs the following:
- a directory of properly formatted Markdown files

## Architecture

- Programming environment: 
  - TypeScript with strict typing
  - on bun (not using Node) 
  - using bun's sqlite features
  - fast-xml-parser for initial parsing of XAML
  - yaml for validating Markdown front matter
- modular
- only one main file (src/cli.ts) will have all the CLI command functionality
- all other TypeScript files must be modularized in such a way that they can be used for a CLI, Electron or Web application

## Tasks
1. Analyze and document the relevant sqlite databases
2. Analyze and document the relevant data formats
   - Bible Reference format
   - Book Reference format
   - Notes in XAML Rich Text format
3. Convert XAML Rich Text to Markdown
4. Add References and Metadata (front matter) to Markdown Notes 

## Note:
- Indexed Tina and NextJS documents are not used for this project
