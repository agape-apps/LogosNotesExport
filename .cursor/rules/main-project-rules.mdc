# Logos Notes Exporter and Converter

A simple node based CLI exporter that converts Logos Notes to Markdown files

The command takes one or more database files as input
- with options for database file locations
- with options for the type of output file
- with options to read all notes or notes from ID to ID

It outputs the following:
- an intermediate JSON file
- an intermediate text file with the Blobs decoded into XAML
- possibly more intermediate files on the path from XAML to Markdown
- a directory of properly formatted Markdown files - one file per not with YAML metadata on top

## Architecture

- Programming environment: TypeScript on Bun (not Node)
- modular
- all script files must be modularized so that they can be used for a CLI, Electron or Web application
- only one main file will have all the CLI command functionality

## Tasks
1. Analyze and document the relevant undocumented sqlite databases
2. Analyze and document the relevant undocumented data formats
   - Bible Reference Format
   - Notes encoded or compressed Blob format
3. Convert decoded XAML blobs to Markdown
4. Add References and Metadata to Markdown Notes

## Note:
- Indexed Tina and NextJS documents are not used for this project
